# Canvas ECG display

This code draws different ECG rhythms and artifacts on HTML canvas using Javascript.
An actual ECG signal is not utilized: everything displayed here is supposed to mimic different things seen on an ECG display. Check out my other repository for a live data implementation: [live-canvas-ecg-display](https://github.com/smappaa/live-canvas-ecg-display).
